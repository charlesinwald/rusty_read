# Rusty Read
# Rust Command Line File Browser

This project is a command line file browser built in Rust, utilizing the `crossterm` and `tui` libraries for cross-platform terminal handling and to build a text user interface (TUI), respectively. It's designed to offer a simple, intuitive interface for navigating and viewing the contents of your filesystem.

## Features

- Cross-platform support, thanks to `crossterm`.
- Interactive TUI for browsing file system directories.
- Supports keyboard navigation with arrow keys, enter to navigate into directories, and backspace to go up.
- Highlights directories in green and marks the current selection with a blue background for clarity.
